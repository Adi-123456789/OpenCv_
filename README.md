# OpenCV Projects

## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of functionalities for image and video processing, including object detection, feature extraction, image filtering, and more. OpenCV is widely used in various fields such as robotics, augmented reality, medical imaging, and surveillance.

## Project 1: Camera Image Capture
### Overview:
This project captures an image from the camera and displays it using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

### Requirements:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### Instructions:
1. Run the provided Python script.
2. The script will access the camera and capture an image.
3. The captured image will be displayed using Matplotlib.

## Project 2: Face Detection in Images
### Overview:
This project detects faces in an image using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.

### Requirements:
- Python
- OpenCV

### Instructions:
1. Ensure Python and OpenCV are installed.
2. Download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml dataset or use the provided one.
3. Run the Python script with an image file.
4. The script will detect faces in the image and display it with bounding boxes around the detected faces.
